# devanagari-rf
Used a Random Forest classifier, image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to classify a dataset containing images of Hindi characters. The model had an accuracy of 86.25% on a hidden test set.

This was a project done as a part of coursework with my partner, Ananya Chenny Rahul. The goal was to build a model that can correctly classify a Devanagari letter. Our model uses a random forest and extensive data augmentation, and has achieved tan accuracy of 86.25% on a hidden test set, which is the highest in the cohort.

The dataset contains 1000 images in the training set, 200 images in the validation set, and 200 images in a hidden test set. The training set contains individual folders for each of the letters. Labels for each class are provided as the file name. For the testing and validation sets, folders contain images, along with a csv file containing corresponding labels.
