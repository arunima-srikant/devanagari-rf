# devanagari-rf
Used a Random Forest classifier, image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to classify a dataset containing images of Hindi characters. The model had an accuracy of 86.25% on a hidden test set.

This was a project done as a part of coursework with my partner, Ananya Chenny Rahul. The goal was to build a model that can correctly classify a Devanagari letter. Our model uses a random forest and extensive data augmentation, and has achieved tan accuracy of 86.25% on a hidden test set, which is the highest in the cohort.
